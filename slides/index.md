### About "great success" project (dark side)
- Main product 
- New feature request (Weather)
- Two external consultants hired for this job
- They interpreted user story as they wanted to
- No continuos integration or deployment. They used FileZilla to push the code to the cloud :smile:
- Unsatisfied customers stared to quit agreements
- Company started to have real problems...

> 15 days of coding may save you 1 day of event storming....

### About "great success" project (there is hope)

Two braves developers already hired in company said they may know the solution, but they need to start it from scratch....

***

### Why consultants failed? 
- Bad interpretation of user story 
- No CD/CD means no code review, tests, possibility to quick revert changes and **no agility**
