### ~~Agile~~ Continuous...

### About great success project (dark side)

- Two external consultants hired for this job
- They interpreted user story as they wanted to
- No continuos integration or deployment. They used FileZilla to push the code to the cloud :-O
- Unsatisfied customers stared to quite agreements
- Company started to have real problems...

> 15 days of coding may save you 1 day of event storming....

### About great success project (there is hope)

Two braves developers already hired in company said they may know the solution, but the need to start it from scratch....

***

### Why consultants failed? 
- Bad interpretation of user story 
- No CD/CD means no code review, tests, possibility to quick revert changes
